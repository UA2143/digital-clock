# digital-clock

This is a project to create a digital clock on python. It takes input from the user to take the font, size of font, backgorund color, and foreground color from the user. 
The user can skip out on giving values on font, background color and foreground color because python will automotically give default values. However you must assign a value to size otherwise it will cause an error.

Only the fonts in the tkinter module are supported. You can always add custom fonts.
